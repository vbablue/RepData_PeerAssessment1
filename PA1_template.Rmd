## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(dplyr)

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity[is.na(activity)] <- 0
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
activity_sum <- activity %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(count = sum(steps), mean_steps= mean(steps), median_steps=median(steps))
```

###Histogram here
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
bar <- ggplot(activity_sum, aes(x=date, y=count)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 
bar
```

##Mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
summary <- activity_sum %>% 
                  select(date, mean_steps, median_steps)

summary
```
